- store users encountered in cloudant 
- store #commits made by each user on each day
    - theres a problem (leak) where a commit from Git-Monitor repo is getting re-added each time

- update UI for users heatmaps
- update UI with "Running on IBM Bluemix" ad
- update UI with "track this repository" toggle 
    - this should send an invite to the repository from git-monitor
    - similarily, git-monitor should scrape the web ui for invites and 'track' repositories that way

- somewhere in there: gitlab repository support
