- host on stage1.bluemix
  - figure out how to cache git-monitor's credentials for multiple accounts (ie gitlab, github, and ids)
    - GHE is different as it uses SSH to clone 

- fix up UI 
  - heatmap adapts to screen size
    - vertical for mobile, automatically resize on window size change events
  - update about page and description on landing page
  - eventually: update materialize

- encryption 

- 'squad' heatmaps
  - more efficient cloudant query for squads
    -> instead of searching each repo individually, build a query that selects an array of repos

- user heatmaps
- store users encountered in cloudant 
- update UI for users heatmaps
- update UI with "Running on IBM Bluemix" ad
- update UI with "track this repository" toggle  ??? is this necessary ?
    - this should send an invite to the repository from git-monitor
    - similarily, git-monitor should scrape the web ui for invites and 'track' repositories that way
