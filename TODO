- store users encountered in cloudant 
- 'squad' heatmaps

- update UI for users heatmaps
- update UI with "Running on IBM Bluemix" ad
- update UI with "track this repository" toggle 
    - this should send an invite to the repository from git-monitor
    - similarily, git-monitor should scrape the web ui for invites and 'track' repositories that way

- somewhere in there: gitlab repository support
