- store #commits per day for each repo in cloudant
    - build an array of RepoCommits
        - check the dates on the commit log and concatenate them into single days (ie remove the time from the date string)
        - compare LastId in cloudant, and update cloudant with any RepoCommits that come after LastId 
- store users encountered in cloudant
- store #commits made by each user on each day
- update UI for users heatmaps
- update UI with "Running on IBM Bluemix" ad
- update UI with "track this repository" toggle 
    - this should send an invite to the repository from git-monitor
    - similarily, git-monitor should scrape the web ui for invites and 'track' repositories that way

- somewhere in there: gitlab repository support
