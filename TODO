- need to get retrieval of list of commits in cloudant working, for updater to work
- store users encountered in cloudant
- store #commits made by each user on each day
- update UI for users heatmaps
- update UI with "Running on IBM Bluemix" ad
- update UI with "track this repository" toggle 
    - this should send an invite to the repository from git-monitor
    - similarily, git-monitor should scrape the web ui for invites and 'track' repositories that way

- somewhere in there: gitlab repository support
